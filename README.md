This dataset was collected using a GelSight tactile sensor and consists of tactile data capturing surface micro-defects. It includes four categories—Normal, Bump, Pit, and Scratch—with a total of 3,949 samples.

 
We encourage the community to use this dataset to advance research in tactile-based surface micro-defect detection.

 
If you use this dataset in your work, we would greatly appreciate it if you cite our paper:
