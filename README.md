📌 **Dataset Description**

This dataset was collected using a GelSight tactile sensor and contains tactile data of surface micro-defects across different surfaces.
It includes four defect categories: Normal, Bump, Pit, and Scratch, with a total of 3,949 samples.

The dataset is designed to support research on tactile-based surface micro-defect detection, particularly in scenarios where visual inspection is challenging.
